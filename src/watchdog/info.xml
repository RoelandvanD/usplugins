<!-- What does your plugin do? -->
  <description>The watchdog plugin is primarily designed for SPAs, but you may find other uses for it. Essentially it has the client check in with the server every X amount of time to see if there are any tasks that need to be performed. This could be logging the client out, refreshing the page, redirecting, or sending a message.  SPA Single Page Applications</description>
